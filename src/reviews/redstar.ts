    fullReview: `The chips came out warm, and that's about as far as the magic went. 
    The chips are thin and flavorless, with a texture that leaves you sad and unsatisfied. 
    The salsa tries to make you forget about your pain with a small burst of spice, but 
    unfortunately ends with a watery, flavorless mess.`,
