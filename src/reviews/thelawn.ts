    summary: "A decadent exterior fails to hide lackluster flavors.",
    fullReview: `At The Lawn, a hipster beach club adjacent to the nearby shore of Canggu, 
    one finds themselves with a variety of flavorful options. If one chooses to select 
    the chips and dips, one can buy a short reprieve from people watching and 
    sunbathing to indulge themselves. We tasted three chip varieties, potato, 
    sweet potato, and taro root, all seasoned with just a dash of salt. There 
    was nothing surprising at all to taste inside the guacamole, which may be 
    intended as to not distract you from the sexual energy that is clearly so carefully 
    cultivated by one of the most expensive beach clubs on the western Bali coast.`,
