    fullReview: `Walking into Matador, a low key establishment in the heart of Ballard, I was impressed immediately that this would be somewhat of a classic new American Mexican spot. While it mostly lived up to expectations, the food was better than expected, a welcome surprise. We got the chips and guacamole, which came with 3 flavorful salsas, including a verde and a fruity habanero. The chips were a bit crunchy, but had above average flavor and kept their structure well on the tongue. The guacamole was simple, but nice. I would return, as Matador stands out boldly from Seattle mediocrity.`,
