    fullReview: `Walking into Bocas, you are immediately swept away from the bustle 
    of Canggu and into a mini oasis. The decor reminds of a upscale LA taqueria, but 
    it is here in the heart of Bali where faint aromas of Mexico graze by your nose. 
    Talking tortillas, the fresh chips are brought to your table swiftly, with a bit 
    of warmth still left clinging to their fried shells. Unfortunately, within minutes 
    they end up being hard, crunchy, and difficult to chew. To their credit, the chips 
    are well flavored and salted, and the paired salsas are both flavorful and spicy. 
    I particularly liked the salsa verde, and the guacamole was tasty and nice to look at.

    The tortilla wrapping the California burrito was well warmed and devoid of char, it's 
    flour well balancing to the multitude of flavors within. The side of hot sauce lended 
    the burrito an excellent kick of flavor, who doesn't love a little well dressed Tabasco?

    While not the worst, I would not return for the chips alone.`,
