    fullReview: `Chip is strong in flavor, texture, and structural integrity. 
    They clearly have been sitting on the counter waiting for patrons, 
    hence their cold, slightly stale appearance. Salsa is perfectly flavored and spicy, 
    with bold direction with both fruity and smokey notes.`,
