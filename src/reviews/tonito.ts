    fullReview: `At the side of the Jewel of Singapore, the highlight of the international airport, 
    with a view overlooking a cascading waterfall, sits Tonito. Tonito's moderately overpriced airport chips
    were warm, soft, lightly salted, and nice to eat. While this was a nice change of pace from many of the chips
    I had eaten recently, the salsa was something reminiscent of a tomato pasta sauce. While I wouldn't order again,
    I might stop in again for the views.`,
