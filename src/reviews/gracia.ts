    fullReview: `While the chips are warm and flavorful, they are a tad oily, and with 
    their fluffy exterior, they make me miss the days of simplicity in chips. 
    The salsa on the other hand is delightful, our sampler gave us 3 distinct well 
    thought through options to dip from. The habanero was my favorite, but the classic 
    green verde salsa brightened up the chips nicely as well.`,
